## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The automation process follows these steps:

1.  **Scrape Reels**: The tool scrapes the latest Reels from the specified Instagram accounts.
2.  **Populate Google Sheets**: New Reel URLs, along with metadata like username and Reel ID, are added to a Google Sheet. Duplicates are automatically skipped.
3.  **Extract Descriptions**: (Optional) The description for each Reel is extracted and added to the sheet.
4.  **Upload to Google Drive**: (Optional) The videos are downloaded and uploaded to your Google Drive.
5.  **Update Status**: The status of each Reel is updated in the Google Sheet, giving you a clear overview of the workflow (`pending`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed`).

## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   Google Chrome or Chromium
*   A Google Cloud project with the Google Sheets and Google Drive APIs enabled.
*   An Instagram account (for authentication to extract descriptions).

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/i2yt.git
cd i2yt
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Automated Setup (Recommended)

**For quick setup, use the automated setup script:**

```bash
python setup.py
```

This script will:
- Install all Python dependencies
- Create `config.py` from the template
- Check Chrome WebDriver availability
- Display next steps with clear instructions

### 4. Configure Google API Access (Manual Setup)

If you prefer manual setup or need to understand each step:

You'''ll need to set up a Google Service Account to allow the application to access your Google Sheet and Google Drive.

1.  Follow the official Google Cloud documentation to create a service account and download the `credentials.json` file.
    *   [Enable Google Sheets API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/sheets.googleapis.com)
    *   [Enable Google Drive API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/drive.googleapis.com)
2.  Place the `credentials.json` file in the root directory of the project.
3.  Share your Google Sheet with the service account email address (Editor permissions).

**‚ö†Ô∏è Google Drive Important Note**: Service accounts cannot upload to their own Google Drive due to storage quota limitations. For Google Drive uploads, you need to either:
- Use a Google Workspace Shared Drive (add service account as Content Manager)
- Share a personal folder with the service account (Editor permissions)
- See [detailed setup guide](docs/google_sheets_setup.md#phase-5-google-drive-setup-optional) for complete instructions

### 5. Create Your Configuration

Copy the template to create your own configuration file:

```bash
copy config_template.py config.py
```

Now, open `config.py` and customize it with your details:

*   `INSTAGRAM_URLS`: A list of Instagram accounts to scrape.
*   `GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID`: The ID of your Google Sheet (from its URL).
*   `UPLOAD_TO_GOOGLE_DRIVE`: Set to `True` to enable uploads.
*   `DRIVE_FOLDER_ID`: The ID of the Google Drive folder for uploads.

### 6. Run the Scraper

You can run the scraper in multiple ways:

#### Option A: Direct Python Execution
```bash
python run_scraper.py
```

#### Option B: PowerShell Script
```powershell
.\run_scraper.ps1
```

#### Option C: Windows Batch Launcher (Recommended for Windows)

For Windows users, a convenient batch file launcher is provided:

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: You must update the path in the batch file before first use!**

1. Open `Launch_Instagram_Scraper.bat` in a text editor
2. Find this line:
   ```batch
   start wt -p "PowerShell" --title "Instagram Reel Scraper" pwsh -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "d:\Kodo\i2yt\run_scraper.ps1"
   ```
3. Replace `"d:\Kodo\i2yt\run_scraper.ps1"` with the full path to your project directory
   
   **Example:** If your project is in `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\i2yt\`, change it to:
   ```batch
   start wt -p "PowerShell" --title "Instagram Reel Scraper" pwsh -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Users\YourName\Documents\i2yt\run_scraper.ps1"
   ```

4. Save the file and double-click to run

**Features of the Batch Launcher:**
- Opens a new Windows Terminal with PowerShell
- Sets the correct working directory automatically
- Runs with bypass execution policy
- Can be launched from anywhere (desktop, taskbar, etc.)
- Keeps the terminal open so you can see the results
- Provides an interactive menu for different operations

**üìñ For detailed information on all execution methods, see [Running Guide](docs/running_guide.md)**
